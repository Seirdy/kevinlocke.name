<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to Kevin Locke's home on the web.&nbsp; This website is being
built to provide all sorts of useful information and plenty of
humorous/insightful/eclectic tidbits.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>This website is a work in progress and not yet fully developed.&nbsp; All
links should work and information should be accurate, however, content is
seriously lacking and the design may feel somewhat clumsy until more media is
added.&nbsp; If there is anything that should be added or if you have a
suggestion/change to the layout that would make the site better
<a href="contact">let me know about it</a>.</p>

<h2>Which Kevin Locke is this?</h2>
<p>As unusual as this may sound, there are more than one of me.&nbsp; Or, at
least, there is more than one person with the name Kevin Locke.&nbsp; So, 
to differentiate myself from the other Kevin Lockes of the world,
I'll provide a quick description of who I am and some information for a few
other Kevin Lockes that I have come across.</p>
<p>Who am I?&nbsp; I am the son of
<a href="http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~ueswl/">William Locke</a> and Charlene
Locke, and the brother of Brian Locke.&nbsp; I 
grew up in Bozeman, MT (in the United States), attended and graduated from
Cornell University in Ithaca, NY with a degree in Computer Science, and I am
a founder and president of <a href="http://digitalenginesoftware.com">Digital
Engine Software</a>.&nbsp; I am involved in
open-source software and the community surrounding it.&nbsp; If you are still unsure
if I am the Kevin Locke you are looking for, see if one of my
<a href="contact">contact points</a> looks familiar, or feel free to ask me.
</p>
