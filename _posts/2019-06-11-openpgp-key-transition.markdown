title: OpenPGP Key Transition to 0x498A12A1584EA6F9
description: >-
  OpenPGP key transition statement moving from 0x5FF14E6B8CE71E1C to 0x498A12A1584EA6F9.

For a number of reasons, including the use of better cryptographic
algorithms and key management using a hardware security module
exclusively, I have recently set up a new OpenPGP key and will be
transitioning away from my old one.

The old key will continue to be valid for some time, but I prefer
that the new key be used whenever possible.

The old key was [0x5FF14E6B8CE71E1C]({% link pgpkey-8CE71E1C.asc %}):

    pub   dsa1024/0x5FF14E6B8CE71E1C 2007-03-17
          Key fingerprint = 03CF 7D34 460F BCE6 E8B4  DA43 5FF1 4E6B 8CE7 1E1C

The new key is [0x498A12A1584EA6F9]({% link pgpkey-498A12A1584EA6F9.asc %}):

    pub   rsa4096/0x498A12A1584EA6F9 2019-06-11
          Key fingerprint = E98C 0D0D 7CD6 8D7D DDCF  7034 498A 12A1 584E A6F9

The [full text of this transition
statement]({% link pgpkey-498A12A1584EA6F9-transition-statement.asc %}), signed by both keys and including instructions for use and verification, is also
available.
