[Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) is a web-based project management system, often called a forge, built
using the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework. It provides bug/issue tracking, time
tracking, wiki pages, gantt charting and calendar, multiple project support,
and role-based access control for users to name a few. This article will cover
the process of installing Redmine on Debian Squeeze using MySQL for data
storage, Thin for serving Ruby, and nginx as the outward-facing server.
