Just a quick note:  I wanted to work with fonts from [Google Web
Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) offline.  Unfortunately, the source code
only contains TTF files and I was unable to find either a trusted converter
utility for all formats or a way to download non-TTF formats.  So, I wrote a
[simple utility to download the fonts](https://gist.github.com/4029594).
Perhaps you will find it useful.
