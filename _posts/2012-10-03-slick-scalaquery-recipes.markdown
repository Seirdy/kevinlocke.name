I recently started using [SLICK](http://slick.typesafe.com/) (formerly
[ScalaQuery](http://scalaquery.org/)) for database access in a Scala project.
In the process of wrapping my head around how SLICK, I'm documenting some
"recipes" for common queries.  Unfortunately, this post got published before
the recipes were ready.  (Oops!)  But, not to worry, I'll post them here (or a
link from here) once they are ready.
