<p class="admonition">This post was converted from a page I put together
several years ago.  It is presented here for posterity and in the hopes that it
may still be useful in some way.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL)</a>
library provides several methods of displaying images, many of which may be
used interchangeably.  In order to help developers choose which method to
use in a given set of situations, this post presents performance numbers for
a variety of these display methods.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<!-- What is SDL, what is a blit, what are the meanings of each of the flags 
-->
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL)</a> is a
cross-platform multimedia library which has been used in the creation of 
several games, emulators, and other graphically driven applications.&nbsp; SDL 
provides low-level access to the graphics system, allowing program authors to 
maximize the performance of their program through precise use of the available 
graphics hardware.&nbsp; However, with this power comes a certain level of 
complexity as well as variability from differences in the hardware and the 
drivers used to control it.&nbsp; The benchmarks/statistics on this page
are intended to clear up some of the doubt about the performance 
characteristics of video backends under some of the different sets of 
configuration options available, allowing program authors to make better
informed decisions about which settings to use in their applications.</p>

<h4>Flags</h4>
<p>When a surface is created, the program author may specify a set of flags
which change the behavior of the surface created.&nbsp; The image flags tested
were:</p>
<dl>
<dt>SDL_HWSURFACE</dt>
<dd>Instructs SDL to create the surface in video memory.&nbsp; This flag means
that the surface will reside in the video memory except when the surface is
locked.&nbsp; This allows the surface to be drawn to the screen very quickly
when it is also a hardware surface since it avoids the need to send as much
data over the AGP (or PCI) bus to the video card.&nbsp; However, this option
increases the overhead each time the surface needs to be modified, since it
must first be locked and moved from video memory into main memory and then
moved back to video memory when it is unlocked.</dd>
<dt>SDL_SRCCOLORKEY</dt>
<dd>Instructs SDL not to draw pixels matching a certain color, called the color
key.&nbsp; This option allows an image to have transparency without requiring
an alpha channel.&nbsp; When the image is drawn to the screen all pixels
matching the color key are omitted, resulting in the underlying image showing
through.</dd>
<dt>SDL_RLEACCEL</dt>
<dd>Enables RLE acceleration for the surface.&nbsp; RLE acceleration is a
process used to decrease the time required to draw a color keyed image to the
screen.&nbsp; As with a hardware surface, the reduction in draw time has a
corresponding increase in modification time.&nbsp; Each time the image needs to
be modified it must be locked, which causes the image to have the RLE process
undone, then redone when the image is unlocked.</dd>
<dt>SDL_SRCALPHA</dt>
<dd>Enables alpha-blending for the surface.&nbsp; Alpha blending causes the
pixels of an image to be blended with, rather than overwriting, the pixels
currently on the screen according to the alpha value of the pixel.&nbsp; This
allows for transparency effects as well as gradual blending between
images.&nbsp; Dealing with blending and an alpha channel does allow for
significantly more artistic control and effects at the cost of some
processing.&nbsp; The exact cost is the subject of these tests.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Along with the options described above, which apply to images, there are
several options which affect the behavior of the screen (drawing surface).&nbsp;
The ones tested here are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>SDL_HWSURFACE</dt>
<dd>Causes similar behavior as when used for surfaces.&nbsp; The display surface
will be created in video memory rather than main memory.&nbsp; This allows for
faster drawing of images onto the screen, since the display surface does not
need to be transferred to the video card after every frame.</dd>
<dt>SDL_DOUBLEBUF</dt>
<dd>Causes the display surface to be double buffered.&nbsp; This means that
there are effectively 2 display surfaces.&nbsp; Screen updates will be drawn
to the surface that is not being displayed, then a call to <code>SDL_Flip</code>
will cause the updated surface to be displayed and the other surface to be
set to receive future updates.&nbsp; This prevents tearing effects from
appearing on the screen as different parts of the screen are updated.&nbsp;
Instead it allows the entire screen to be updated in a single action, creating
a more unified picture.  Note:  SDL_DOUBLEBUF requires a hardware surface to
work, so specifying SDL_DOUBLEBUF is equivalent to SDL_DOUBLEBUF|SDL_HWSURFACE
(the long form is used below for clarity).</dd>
<dt>SDL_FULLSCREEN</dt>
<dd>Causes the program to run in fullscreen mode.&nbsp; Although at first this
may not seem like it would have any effect on the drawing speed of a program,
it can actually have a great deal.&nbsp; Many video backends will not create
a hardware surface if the program is not running fullscreen, it also may not
allow the window to be double buffered.&nbsp; Even beyond these limitations,
it does seem to have some effect on the performance (I am not exactly sure why
and would rather avoid guessing...).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Test Setup</h3>
<p>The test program takes an image and converts to the display format using
the specified surface flags.&nbsp; For surfaces with
<code>SDL_SRCCOLORKEY</code> set, it converts completely transparent pixels
into color-keyed pixels.&nbsp; The test program then blits the image to the
screen 1000 times, as fast as it can and records the time required to complete 
the blits, then calculates the framerate based on this time.&nbsp; The program
runs at a resolution of 800x600.&nbsp; For the exact details, please consult
the <a href="sdltest.cpp">source to the test program</a>.</p>

<p>Note that this is not necessarily a fair comparison, since in "real-world" 
conditions blits would be sent at greater intervals.&nbsp; However, for testing 
this would bring up problems with measurement errors for the timing of 
individual blits (requiring very high precision) or with the precision of sleep 
functions used to space out the blits.&nbsp; Given these caveats, the test 
results do seem to agree with the experienced performance under more practical 
conditions and none of the backends seem to be limiting themselves to the 
vertical refresh rate or any other constraint requiring greater spacing of the 
blits.</p>

<p>The image used for the tests was a scaled version of Klowner's
<a href="http://www.dugnet.org/klown/wallpaper/show.php?id=_wallpaper/_linux/seehearspeak">See,
Hear, Speak...</a> wallpaper (the exact image used for testing is
<a href="seehearspeak-transparent.png">here</a>).&nbsp; This image was chosen
because it is similar to typical sprites found in 2D games
(gradients with few colors, alpha around the edge of the images, rounded edges)
and because it is just a really cute image.</p>

<h4>Test Machine</h4>

<h3>Results</h3>

<h4>DirectFB</h4>
<a href="directfb.svg"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="directfb.svg" width="600" height="300"><img src="directfb.png" alt="Graph displaying blit speed for the DirectFB video backend" width="600" height="300" /></object></a>
<p>The DirectFB video backend is used to display graphics on a Linux
framebuffer device (the console) using <a href="http://www.directfb.org/">Direct
FB</a>.&nbsp; On the test system, DirectFB was running in the console on top of
the vesa frame buffer.&nbsp; Although the test program runs at 800x600, DirectFB
was unable to resize my display from 1024x768.&nbsp; This left a black border
around the edges of the screen which, although not really important for a test
program, may be a consideration for programs where visual appeal and use of
screen space is important.&nbsp; Also, fullscreen hardware surfaces were only
available at 16 bits (which may be a result of my vesafb configuration), so the
test results for this configuration should be considered with this
limitation.</p>
<p>During the testing of this video backend several notable characteristics of
the backend appeared that may be worth considering before deploying a program
using this backend.  When SDL_FULLSCREEN
was used for the display surface it caused the image to appear significantly
off-center such that it wrapped around the edge of the monitor.&nbsp; On top of
that, the color keyed images showed (sometimes significant) blinking or tearing
for the hardware display surfaces, although the framerate is recorded as being
impressively high (this needs further investigation).&nbsp; Finally, surfaces
with the SDL_SRCALPHA flag did not render when the display surface was a
hardware surface, so the numbers for this configuration are somewhat
meaningless.</p>
<p>As one other implementation note, it may be necessary to pass
<code>video=vesafb:ywrap,mtrr</code> to the kernel in order to enable hardware
surfaces.&nbsp; DirectFB complained loudly before I added the line to the boot
configuration.&nbsp; See the DirectFB documentation for details.</p>

<h4>DirectX</h4>
<a href="directx.svg"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="directx.svg" 
width="600" height="300"><img src="directx.png" alt="Graph displaying blit 
speed for the DirectX video backend" width="600" height="300" /></object></a>
<p>The DirectX video backend provides graphics support using
<a href="http://microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft DirectX&reg;</a> on Microsoft 
Windows&reg; platforms.&nbsp; There were no unexpected visual effects
or strangeness during the testing, although some of the results were
unexpected.&nbsp; The first oddity was the
surprisingly low framerate for surfaces with the <code>SDL_SRCALPHA</code>
flag on a <code>SDL_HWSURFACE</code> display surface.&nbsp; In fact, the low 
framerate caused the test to run for a long enough time that there was debate 
about whether or not the test had frozen.&nbsp; Another oddity was the low 
framerate on the double-buffered display surface.&nbsp; My guess is that when 
double-buffered the render code waits for a vblank before finishing, so the 
framerate is capped at the refresh rate of the monitor (which would explain the 
60 fps recorded for double-buffered output on the test machine).&nbsp; One 
other caveat to note is that it is not possible to allocate a hardware surface 
unless the display surface is fullscreen (and a hardware surface, of
course).</p>

<h4>FBCon</h4>
<a href="fbcon.svg"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="fbcon.svg" width="400" height="300"><img src="fbcon.png" alt="Graph displaying blit speed for the FBCon video backend" width="400" height="300" /></object></a>
<p>The FBCon video backend provides graphics support for consoles using the
<a href="http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/">Linux Framebuffer</a>.&nbsp;
Although this driver does support hardware display surfaces, requesting a 
display surface with <code>SDL_HWSURFACE</code> caused the test machine to hard
lock and prevented gathering any test data for these surfaces.&nbsp; (Note that
this may be worth checking against before allocating a hardware display surface
to prevent hard locking a client's machine).</p>

<h4>glSDL</h4>
<a href="glsdl.svg"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="glsdl.svg" width="600" height="300"><img src="glsdl.png" alt="Graph displaying blit speed for the glSDL video backend" width="400" height="300" /></object></a>
<p>The glSDL video backend stands out in comparison to many of the other
backends in that it works in concert with another backend to
blit images using OpenGL.&nbsp; This backend may provide performance
improvements on computers with hardware 3D acceleration where the work of
blitting an image can be offloaded to the graphics processor through
OpenGL.&nbsp; In this test, the glSDL backend was running on top of the X11
backend on Linux.</p>
<p>The state of this backend in the SDL community is also somewhat
ambiguous.&nbsp; The original patches to SDL were the work of David Olofson and
Stephane Marchesin, and are available as a
<a href="http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/~marchesin/sdl/glsdl-final.patch">patch
providing the backend</a> or as a
<a href="http://olofson.net/mixed.html">wrapper around SDL</a>.&nbsp; Although
there has been much discussion of including the backend with SDL or in writing
a different implementation of its features, neither solution has materialized
and the backend remains largely unsupported.&nbsp; Even applying the patch to
the latest libSDL requires quite a bit of work.</p>
<p>For this test, a <a href="glsdl-final-reworked1.2.11.patch">reworked version
of the glSDL backend patch</a> against libSDL 1.2.11 was used.&nbsp; However,
there is an error somewhere in the patch which results in color inversions
under many of the testing conditions (whether this was introduced in the
reworking or if it was present in the original patch is unknown).&nbsp; This
appears to be the result of incorrect RGBA ordering in the
<code>DisplayFormatAlpha</code> function (or that only manifests when this
function is used).&nbsp; Hopefully, I will have the time to fix this in the
near future...</p>

<h4>SVGAlib</h4>
<a href="svgalib.svg"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="svgalib.svg" width="400" height="300"><img src="svgalib.png" alt="Graph displaying blit speed for the SVGAlib video backend" width="400" height="300" /></object></a>
<p>The SVGAlib video backend provides graphics support for Linux using
<a href="http://www.svgalib.org/">SVGAlib</a>.&nbsp;  This video backend is not
capable of dealing with hardware surfaces, so those results are omitted from
the graph.&nbsp; Note that the version of SVGAlib used for testing (1.4.3)
requires that the user be root.&nbsp; This likely provides a significant hurdle
for potential end-users of a program using the SVGAlib backend and in addition
it may affect the scheduling of the test program by the operating system and
skew the test results (although I am unsure of this).</p>

<h4>WinDIB</h4>
<a href="windib.svg"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="windib.svg" width="400" height="300"><img src="windib.png" alt="Graph displaying blit speed for the WinDIB video backend" width="400" height="300" /></object></a>
<p>The WinDIB video backend provides graphics support for Microsoft Windows&reg;
platforms using
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536795.aspx">Windows&reg;
<abbr title="Graphics Device Interface">GDI</abbr></a>.&nbsp; This backend does
not support hardware surfaces and therefore those results are omitted from
the graph.</p>

<h4>X11</h4>
<a href="x11.svg"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="x11.svg" width="400" height="300"><img src="x11.png" alt="Graph displaying blit speed for the X11 video backend" width="400" height="300" /></object></a>
<p>The X11 video backend provides graphics support for the
<a href="http://x.org">X Window System</a>.&nbsp; This video backend does not
support hardware surfaces and therefore those results have been omitted from
the graph.</p>

<h4>Notable Missing Backends</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, the test box does not support the
<abbr title="Direct Graphics Architecture">DGA</abbr> extension, which prevents
testing of the DGA video backend.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Across all of the graphics backends the use of RLE acceleration showed a
significant speed increase for color keyed images.&nbsp; Interestingly, the use
of color keys alone shows a highly dramatic decrease in framerate as compared
to both non-color keyed surfaces and surfaces using source alpha.&nbsp; For
surfaces where a color key is required and the surface will not be modified
often, the use of RLE acceleration seems like a must.</p>
<p>The glSDL backend shows particularly high performance for use with hardware
surfaces.&nbsp; If the problems with colors can be overcome, or a new
implementation of an OpenGL-based backend is created, this option seems like
a winner.&nbsp; However, given the current limitations, it does not appear
to be ready for production programs.</p>
<p>Although hardware and double-buffered surfaces are likely to provide the
highest performance, they showed a particularly high degree of strange effects
and poor performance in the test environment.&nbsp; I strongly suggest that if
the use of hardware surfaces is being considered for an SDL application that
a significant amount of testing be done on a variety of systems to ensure
that none of the undesired visual effects or low performance is encountered on
target systems.</p>
<p>Beyond those observations, the best suggestion is to try a few combinations
and see what works best with your program.&nbsp; As always, take it all with
a grain of salt and go with practical experience.  Best of luck!</p>
