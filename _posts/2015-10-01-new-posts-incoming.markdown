This blog has been dead for the last couple of years, without a single post
since the beginning of April, 2013.  In that time I've been preoccupied with
other endeavors, primarily [Quantpost](https://quantpost.com), and haven't had
time to document any of my minor discoveries.  Luckily for readers, this blog
is only mostly-dead, not all-dead, and I am planning to bring it back to life.

I have recently moved to Seattle, WA to attend courses at the [University of
Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) and am planning to make time
available for writing new content.  I have a few drafts of new posts that have
been waiting to be completed since 2013 which are still relevant and useful,
as well as a and a long list of topics that deserve attention which has
accumulated over the past 2 years.  I make no guarantees about the frequency
or volume of upcoming posts, but you can expect several new posts in the next
few weeks and posts on a more regular basis after that.  Perhaps even some
style improvements to make the blog easier to read.  So, without further ado,
on to the new posts!
