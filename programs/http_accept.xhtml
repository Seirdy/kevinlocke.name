<h1>HTTP_Accept</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>HTTP_Accept is a PHP script for dealing with both parsing and constructing
of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.1">HTTP 1.1 Accept
headers</a> according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC
2616</a>.  It is primarily designed to make it easy for web developers
to determine what content to send to clients while following the behavior
detailed in the RFC.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supports quoted strings in parameter values</li>
<li>Supports MIME Types with parameters, quality values, and extension
key/value pairs as well as extension tokens without values</li>
<li>Support for determining the quality factors by best matching (e.g.
<code>text/html</code> will match <code>text/*</code> and
<code>text/html;level=4</code> will match <code>text/html</code>)</li>
<li>Support for determining if a match was exact (useful for browsers which
do not report unsupported subtypes)</li>
<li>Tested under PHP 4 and 5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Status</h2>
<p>Idle.  HTTP_Accept currently supports all of the features that I
need.  I have considered attempting to get it into
<a href="https://pear.php.net">PEAR</a>, and I believe it meets all of the
requirements (with the exception of exceptions, which are not supported in
PHP 4), but I have not been able to muster enough courage to do it.  If
you have places to take the software or features to add, please do!  I
will also happily accept bug reports and feature requests.</p>

<h2>License</h2>
<p><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT</a></p>
