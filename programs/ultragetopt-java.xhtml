configurable behaviors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development Status</h3>
<p>Actively being developed.&nbsp; UltraGetopt for Java supports everything that
I need at the moment.&nbsp; A list of features which I am considering
implementing, as time permits, is included in the TODO file.&nbsp;  Bug fixing
and improved compatibility support will be addressed whenever an issue
arises.&nbsp; As always, if you have a bug to report, feature to request, or the
desire to hack on the software yourself, drop me a line.</p>
