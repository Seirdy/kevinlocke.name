For a number of reasons, including the use of better cryptographic
algorithms and key management using a hardware security module
exclusively, I have recently set up a new OpenPGP key and will be
transitioning away from my old one.

The old key will continue to be valid for some time, but I prefer all
future correspondence to come to the new one.  I would also like this
new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.  This message is
signed by both keys to certify the transition.

The old key was:

pub   dsa1024/0x5FF14E6B8CE71E1C 2007-03-17
      Key fingerprint = 03CF 7D34 460F BCE6 E8B4  DA43 5FF1 4E6B 8CE7 1E1C

The new key is:

pub   rsa4096/0x498A12A1584EA6F9 2019-06-11
      Key fingerprint = E98C 0D0D 7CD6 8D7D DDCF  7034 498A 12A1 584E A6F9

To fetch my new key from a public key server, you can simply do:

  gpg --keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 498A12A1584EA6F9

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 498A12A1584EA6F9

If you don't already know my old key, or you just want to be double
extra paranoid, you can check the fingerprint against the one above:

  gpg --fingerprint 498A12A1584EA6F9

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the UIDs match
what you expect, I'd appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 498A12A1584EA6F9

Lastly, if you could upload these signatures, i would appreciate it.
You can either send me an e-mail with the new signatures (if you have
a functional MTA on your system):

  gpg --armor --export 498A12A1584EA6F9 | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures' kevin@kevinlocke.name

Or you can just upload the signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key 498A12A1584EA6F9

Please let me know if there is any trouble, and sorry for the
inconvenience.

Kevin (with thanks to dkg for this template)
